ELI5 is a Python package which helps to debug machine learning
classifiers and explain their predictions.

   :alt: explain_prediction for text data

It provides support for the following machine learning frameworks and packages:

* scikit-learn_. Currently ELI5 allows to explain weights and predictions
  of scikit-learn linear classifiers and regressors, print decision trees
  as text or as SVG, show feature importances and explain predictions
  of decision trees and tree-based ensembles. ELI5 understands text
  processing utilities from scikit-learn and can highlight text data
  accordingly. It also allows to debug scikit-learn pipelines which contain
  HashingVectorizer, by undoing hashing.

* xgboost_ - show feature importances and explain predictions of XGBClassifier
  and XGBRegressor.

* LightGBM_ - show feature importances and explain predictions of
  LGBMClassifier and LGBMRegressor.

* lightning_ - explain weights and predictions of lightning classifiers and
  regressors.

* sklearn-crfsuite_. ELI5 allows to check weights of sklearn_crfsuite.CRF
  models.

ELI5 also provides TextExplainer_ which allows to explain predictions
of any text classifier using LIME_ algorithm (Ribeiro et al., 2016).
There are utilities for using LIME with non-text data and arbitrary black-box
classifiers as well, but this feature is currently experimental.

Explanation and formatting are separated; you can get text-based explanation
to display in console, HTML version embeddable in an IPython notebook
or web dashboards, or JSON version which allows to implement custom
rendering and formatting on a client.
