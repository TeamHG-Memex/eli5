            Review the codebase for code cleanliness issues:
            1. Identify files that are too large (>500 lines) and suggest how to split them into smaller, focused modules
            2. Look for code duplication and suggest refactoring opportunities
            3. Check for consistent code style and formatting
            4. Identify complex functions that could be simplified
            5. Suggest improvements for code organization and structure
            6. Check for proper separation of concerns
            
            Provide actionable recommendations with specific file names and line numbers.

            3. Remove code duplication
            4. Ensure consistent code style
            5. Improve code organization and structure
