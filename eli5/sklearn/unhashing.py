    Unlike HashingVectorizer it can be fit. During fitting
    InvertableHashingVectorizer learns which input terms map to which
    feature columns/signs; this allows to provide more meaningful
    :meth:`get_feature_names`. The cost is that it is no longer stateless.

    You can fit InvertableHashingVectorizer on a random sample of documents
    (not necessarily on the whole training and testing data), and use it
    to inspect an existing HashingVectorizer instance.

    If several features hash to the same value, they are ordered by
    their frequency in documents that were used to fit the vectorizer.

    :meth:`transform` works the same as HashingVectorizer.transform.
