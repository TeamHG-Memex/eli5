    Return a ``(pos, neg)`` tuple. ``pos`` and ``neg`` are lists of
    ``(name, value)`` tuples for features with positive and negative
    coefficients.

    Parameters:

    * ``feature_names`` - a vector of feature names;
    * ``coef`` - coefficient vector; coef.shape must be equal to
      feature_names.shape;
    * ``top`` can be either a number or a ``(num_pos, num_neg)`` tuple.
      If ``top`` is a number, ``top`` features with largest absolute
      coefficients are returned. If it is a ``(num_pos, num_neg)`` tuple,
      the function returns no more than ``num_pos`` positive features and
      no more than ``num_neg`` negative features.
